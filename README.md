# opensmac
Open-source client for Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri ( + Alien Crossfire )

Note: you will still need original game to play - this client needs it's resources

- Why?

SMAC was a great game, possibly the best in 4x genre, but it's outdated so much it barely runs on modern systems. Especially multiplayer (which is based on ancient directplay).

- What will be same between OpenSMAC and original game?

Models, images, movies, texts, lore, factions, game rules (such as tech trees, types of armor/weapons etc), UI

- What will be completely different?

Graphics engine, network code are fully rewritten to allow it run as smoothly as possible.

- What may differ slightly?

Random maps generation, AI, dynamic music. While I'll try to get them as close as possible to original logic, they will still be recreated from scratch.

- Compatibility?

Network won't be compatible to original client (so you can't play together with somebody running it).

Maybe I'll make saves compatible, but it's very low priority.

- Other improvements?

Once I replicate original game, I'll focus on other things, such as: larger maps, larger maximum number of players, custom mod support, online services such as game browser or hosting long-turns games (where people can login and make 1 turn per day or so), alternative art packs (used instead of original, this may mean better graphics)
